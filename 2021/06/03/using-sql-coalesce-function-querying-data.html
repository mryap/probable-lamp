<p>A Null value is a field with no value.</p>

<p>The Coalesce SQL function returns first non-null expression among its arguments. Null plus anything equals zero and it like zero times anything equals zero. 
For example, when we have to combine e.g. a street name with a postal code, additional address line, etc. 
If one of those has a Null value, the whole thing is going to be Null.</p>

<p>As a data analyst, you will end up with a dataset that has some nulls that youâ€™d prefer to contain actual values. This happens frequently in numerical data (displaying nulls as 0 is often preferable), and when performing outer joins can result in some unmatched rows.</p>

<p>If there is no NULL value, then the first value is returned:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT COALESCE('A', 'B', 'C') AS result

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The output will be A</p>

<p>If there is a NULL value then the first non-null value is returned:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, 'C') AS result
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The output will be C</p>
