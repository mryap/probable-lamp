SQL is becoming a common skill requirement across industries.

Employers require their data analysts, data scientists and product managers (or anyone handling data) to at least be familiar with SQL. 
This is because SQL remains the language of data. So, in order to be data driven, people need to know how to access and analyze data.

One way to handle data is 'point and click'. For that to happen, Jira ticket need to be raised to seek developer resources to build the user interface layer on top of the datasets. There is a faster way if you have access to BigQuery and know your way around with sql.
