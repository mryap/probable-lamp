SQL is becoming a common skill requirement  across industries.

Employers require their data analysts, data scientists and product managers to at least be familiar with SQL. 
This is because SQL remains the language of data. So, in order to be data driven, people need to know how to access and analyze data.

Even if there is a detail documentation, I always wants to get a lay of the land like

- list tables in bigquery dataset with sql
- 

```
SELECT * 
FROM publicdata.samples.__TABLES__
WHERE starts_with(table_id, 'github') 
```
WITH question_answers_join AS (
  SELECT *
    , GREATEST(1, TIMESTAMP_DIFF(answers.first, creation_date, minute)) minutes_2_answer
  FROM (
    SELECT id, creation_date, title
      , (SELECT AS STRUCT MIN(creation_date) first, COUNT(*) c
         FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers` 
         WHERE a.id=parent_id
      ) answers
      , SPLIT(tags, '|') tags
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` a
    WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM creation_date) > 2016
  )
)
