This site is an offshoot of [Test & Optimize](https://www.testandoptimize.com/). It is a collection of TIL (Today I learned) notes. 

A write-ups on small things I learn daily from involving in side projects to work across a variety of languages and technologies. 
These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post.

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1]. From hosting, version control to generating webpages, all is done on GitHub
